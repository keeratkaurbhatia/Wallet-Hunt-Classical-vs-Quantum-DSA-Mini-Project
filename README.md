# 🕵️‍♀️ **The Case of the Missing Wallet: A Classical vs Quantum Mystery**


```

🔦 9 ROOMS. 1 WALLET.
👣 Footsteps echo in the hallway...
💨 Layer maps every corner.
🕳️ Maze dives deep into the dark.
🌀 Rando spins in circles.
⚛️ And somewhere... Strange splits into 9 clones.

💓 A heartbeat spikes.
💫 The energy shifts.
🕰️ The truth surfaces.

```

### 💓 The Quantum Pulse (Feel the magic!)
```

💓 ░░░▄▃▄▅▇█▇▅▄▃▄░░░  
heartbeat rising...
stronger with every iteration...
until the truth amplifies.

```

### 🧩 The Scene
It’s late. The 3rd floor is quiet.  
Your wallet is missing, and logic alone might not cut it this time.
